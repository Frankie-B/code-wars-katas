/**
 * An anagram is a word, a phrase, or a sentence formed from another by rearranging its letters. An example of this is "angel", which is an anagram of "glean".

Write a function that receives an array of words, and returns the total number of distinct pairs of anagramic words inside it.

Some examples:

There are 2 anagrams in the array ["dell", "ledl", "abc", "cba"]
There are 7 anagrams in the array ["dell", "ledl", "abc", "cba", "bca", "bac"]
 */

function anagramCounter(wordsArray) {
    return counter;
}
