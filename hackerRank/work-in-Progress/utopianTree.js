// Utopian Tree - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/utopian-tree/problem?utm_campaign=challenge-recommendation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=7-day-campaign

// The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

// Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after

// growth cycles?

// For example, if the number of growth cycles is

// , the calculations are as follows:

// Period  Height
// 0          1
// 1          2
// 2          3
// 3          6
// 4          7
// 5          14

// Function Description

// Complete the utopianTree function in the editor below. It should return the integer height of the tree after the input number of growth cycles.

// utopianTree has the following parameter(s):

//     n: an integer, the number of growth cycles to simulate

// Input Format

// The first line contains an integer,
// , the number of test cases.
// subsequent lines each contain an integer, , denoting the number of cycles for that test case.
